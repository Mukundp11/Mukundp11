Real Time Scenario
-->If we have some test cases that are dependent on each other so in this case
if single test failed then rest all test will also fail.
-->Ideally if first test failed rest all should go either into skip category or 
not executed.
-->TestNG allow you to create dependency between test and groups as well.

-->Syntax
@Test(dependsOnMethods="start" )
